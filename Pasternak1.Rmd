## Biography

I am a RaMP Fellow in the Landscape Ecology Lab! I am NOT from Philadelphia.

## Favorite field site

One amazing place I'd visited during orientation was the Cahaba River in Alabama. 
- The Cahaba River is the longest free-flowing river in AL at approx. 200 miles.
- The Cahaba Rvvr is home to the endangered Cahaba Lily.
- The River is home to 13 endemic plant and animal species.

## Code
```
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%     
  addMarkers(lng = -87.0643894, lat = 33.0747889, popup = "Cahaba River National Wildlife Refuge")
```
## Tree Basal Area (Still working on it)


```{r}
  dbh <- c(35, 23, 12, NA, 8)
  plot_area <- c(0.1)
Function = function(dbh, plot_area){
  basal_area = ((3.14159265359/4*10000)*dbh^2)
return(basal_area)
}
```
