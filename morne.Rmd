# MornÃ© le Roux
## Biography
I am a graduate student in the Landscape Ecology Lab! I'm currently a second year MS student at Auburn University, where I am also a part of the Forest Disturbance and Resilience Lab. My research focuses on wind-fire disturbance interactions in longleaf pine savannas. In my free time, I like reading, going to concerts, and spending time outside with my dog, Stella. I am also the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. 

## Favorite field site
My favorite field site is the Ichauway Forest Dynamics Plot. Species that can be found there include: 
* Longleaf pine 
* Gopher tortoise 
* Red-cockaded woodflecker
