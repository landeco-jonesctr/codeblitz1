# Nicole Zampieri

## Biography

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Landscape Ecology Lab! I am starting as an Assistant Professor of Biology at UCF later this year. I am a biogeographer and dendroecologist studying growth and demography of savanna trees. Specifically, I study how abiotic factors, like fire and hurricanes, and biotic factors, like competition and facilitation, interact to affect longleaf pine (*Pinus palustris*) growth and ecology. My hobbies include werrking out, baking, playing video games, drinking beer, and spending time with my partner and our two pets, Cloud, a 100 lb Labrador, and Toby, a tuxedo cat. I am an Olympic gold heavy weight champion. 

## Favorite field site

- My favorite field site is called "Ann's Bog" in the Apalachicola National Forrrrest
- This site is full of rare plants like orchids and carnivorous pitcher plants
- It is named after an ecologist who popularized it, Ann Johnson of the Florida Natural Areas Inventory
- It has a funky cypress tree in the shape of a lightning bolt, or the letter Z
