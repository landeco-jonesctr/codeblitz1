## Biography

I am a new seasonal technician for the Landscape Ecology Lab. I'm from Southern 
California and grew up seeing the outdoors as a bit icky with too many bugs. As an older teen,
something changed and forests suddenly became interesting since they were unfamiliar to me and I was used
to the shrubby landscapes of our Mediterranean climate. With my new interest, I went on to major in Geography/Environmental 
Studies and earn my master of Forest Science.  
Lately, I have been enjoying hanging out in all kinds of forests and streams, hands on activities like sewing/crafting/gardening,
and wrestling my cat, Gussie.

## Favorite field site

Luquillo Experimental Forest, *Puerto Rico*   
- Subtropical moist to subtropical rain forest  
- Mountainous landscape: 1,000-meter elevation gradient  
- Field site has the same boundary as the national forest (El Yunque National Forest)  
- Largest tropical forest in the experimintal forest and range system: >28k acres   
- Site has been studied for over 100 years  
- *Fun fact*: I found a transparent semi-slug in the forest that flattens out snd also has slug shape

#my function
my_ba <- function(dbh, dbhunits = "cm", plotsize, standsize) {
  dbh <- as.vector(na.omit(dbh)) #drop dbh NAs
  expfact <- standsize / plotsize #plotsize + standsize must be same units
 
   #diff constants depending on units
  if(dbhunits == "cm") {
    constant <- pi / (4 * 10000)
    ba <- constant * (dbh^2)
